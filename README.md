## About The Project

Insider trading refers to the practice of buying or selling securities by individuals who possess non-public information about a company. This information may include financial results, mergers and acquisitions, or other confidential information that is not yet available to the public. The individuals who engage in insider trading are typically corporate insiders, such as company executives and board members, but it can also include anyone who possesses non-public information.
